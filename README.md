Use case : as any boomer, I sometimes type while looking at the keyboard. And I end up starting sentences having the case all wrong.

This small service listens to keyboard events and detects words like `hELLO `. Then the caps lock is toggled and the word is retyped.

This package is written in Rust and uses [rdev](https://docs.rs/rdev/latest/rdev/) crate. It won't work with Wayland windowing system.
